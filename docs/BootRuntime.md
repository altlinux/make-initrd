# Boot order

- kernel calls `/init`. In the initramfs `/init` is the simplest script which saves the environment variables and starts/stops [services](InitramfsServices.md) on runlevel 3.
- When the root file system found init goes to runlevel 2. Last service on runlevel 2 asks init to restart. When the SysV init receives request to reboot himself uses predefined path (`/sbin/init`).
- `/sbin/init` is another script which removes initramfs, restore kernel environment and runs real init.

# Services

The features may install one or more initialization scripts (or init scripts). An init script shall be installed
in `/etc/init.d` (which may be a symbolic link to another location). The initramfs uses SysV-style [init scripts](InitramfsServices.md).

# Run Levels

Basically run levels are specified for use by the `Default-Start` and `Default-Stop` actions defined in
the [init scripts](InitramfsServices.md). The LSB standard defines them as:

- 0 halt;
- 1 single user mode;
- 2 multiuser with no network services exported;
- 3 normal/full multiuser;
- 4 reserved for local use, default is normal/full multiuser;
- 5 multiuser with a display manager or equivalent;
- 6 reboot;

but implementations are not required to provide these exact run levels or give them the meanings described here.
The initramfs uses following run levels:

- ...
- 2 is used to switch to real system. The switch to this level occurs only after the rootfs is found and mounted.
- 3 default initramfs runtime.
- 9 exec real system in the `/root`.
- ...
